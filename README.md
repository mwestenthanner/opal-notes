# opal-notes

Opal Notes is a minimal notetaking app designed to work primarily on Android and to be paired with ObsidianMD.

The app is currently in Alpha and not ready for everyday use, but can be tested by running it alongside the [Opal server](https://github.com/mwestenthanner/opal-server/) and [Opal Sync Obsidian plugin](https://github.com/mwestenthanner/opal-sync/).
